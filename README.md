🐍 My Daily Python Learning Journey
Hi! I'm currently learning Python and to stay consistent, I’m posting my daily practice code here.
This repo includes basic to intermediate level programs, notes, and exercises that I’m working on every day.

📌 What to Expect:
Simple Python scripts for practice
Code examples of various concepts (loops, functions, lists, etc.)
My progress as I learn and grow in Python

💻 Why I'm Doing This:
To stay consistent with learning
To track my daily progress
To help others who are also beginning their Python journey

Feel free to explore, learn with me, or suggest improvements.
Let’s grow together! 😊
